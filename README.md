GoHaskell
=========

Go game I'm writing to learn haskell.

use '--console' switch to start the game in CLI mode. Gui is WIP now.

What works now:
---------------
  * Console user interface
  * 2 human players on the same computer
  * LAN multiplayer
  * Basic scoring

Planned features:
-----------------
  * Need to improve endgame scoring to account for alive groups
  * Client to online servers (if possible)
  * AI
  * GUI

Installation:
-------------
    git clone https://github.com/xarts19/GoHaskell GoHaskell
    cd GoHaskell
    cabal install  # didn't check
